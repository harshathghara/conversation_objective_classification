"Swami Subramanian, 2025-03-20T13:48:51Z, 2025-03-20T13:49:00Z => And the internship that you did with Auto Solutions.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:48:55Z, 2025-03-20T13:49:06Z => Yes, sir. So my first project was basically a smart india hackathon project It was a woman safety analytics and protecting women from safety threats.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:49:06Z, 2025-03-20T13:49:11Z => So basically it was an AI driven surveillance system for the protection of women.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:49:10Z, 2025-03-20T13:49:17Z => Like, you know, nowadays if especially if you talk about india you see so many incidents which happen with women.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:49:18Z, 2025-03-20T13:49:32Z => So this was a concern which was going on in the society so we thought of take it like this inspired of taking this problem statement for the hackathon And like we implemented ai based solution for this problem.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:49:32Z, 2025-03-20T13:49:44Z => And like overall 500 teams had submitted their idea all over the India and like five, six people were shortlisted for this And we represented this problem statement in IIT Jammu as well.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:49:44Z, 2025-03-20T13:50:01Z => So in last December. So basically what our system does is like, you know, the traffic like we install you install the cameras and all any kind of surveillance system like Our camera only you can see. On the street lights",-1
"Swami Subramanian, 2025-03-20T13:49:46Z, 2025-03-20T13:49:52Z => So…",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:50:02Z, 2025-03-20T13:50:21Z => Basically, it records the videos And like it breaks those videos into different different frames and in the frames, our model detects the if any woman is present or not in that frame And if the woman is present, it's basically after that it checks for the SOS gesture.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:50:22Z, 2025-03-20T13:50:43Z => If the woman sold the SO signals Then our model sends an alert and the concerned authorities which are like doing the surveillance take immediate action like, okay, this area the woman is having threat and they call the police station and those people reach there",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T13:50:43Z, 2025-03-20T13:50:50Z => How do you figure out whether it's a woman",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:50:44Z, 2025-03-20T13:50:55Z => So this was So there are so many models uh like we used open pose for that, sir.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:50:55Z, 2025-03-20T13:51:05Z => To detect that a person yeah there are so many pre-turned model you yolo and all are there for the object detection only So those things we used.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T13:50:57Z, 2025-03-20T13:51:04Z => And is it good like",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T13:51:04Z, 2025-03-20T13:51:11Z => Okay. And how good are these models like so for example like what is the false positives or false negatives.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:51:05Z, 2025-03-20T13:51:11Z => And…",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:51:11Z, 2025-03-20T13:51:25Z => Yeah, sir. There were cases where we had to deal with this false negative cases So we had to actually train our model like we had to fine tune and all everything we had to do to make them work properly.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T13:51:26Z, 2025-03-20T13:51:32Z => And like what do you do what was the",-1
"Swami Subramanian, 2025-03-20T13:51:26Z, 2025-03-20T13:51:39Z => So did you get data so did you get data for like the women who were showing the SOS signal",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:51:32Z, 2025-03-20T13:51:53Z => Sir, so actually Yeah, sir. Actually, we used like we didn't implement it to live life scenarios, but we took data from kaggle itself So that Kaggle is basically a platform where we find the data are so many kinds of data set which for them",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T13:51:45Z, 2025-03-20T13:51:52Z => What is gaggle, actually?",-1
"Swami Subramanian, 2025-03-20T13:51:52Z, 2025-03-20T13:51:58Z => It's a synthetic data source, right?",-1

"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T13:51:57Z, 2025-03-20T13:52:01Z => It's a made up data source. Okay. Hmm.",-1
"Swami Subramanian, 2025-03-20T13:51:58Z, 2025-03-20T13:52:09Z => Hmm. So any reason you went on the video side and not on the voice side",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:52:05Z, 2025-03-20T13:52:13Z => Like, see, it was specified in the problem statement itself that you will be having video recordings only.",-1
"Swami Subramanian, 2025-03-20T13:52:11Z, 2025-03-20T13:52:15Z => Okay. Mm-hmm.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:52:13Z, 2025-03-20T13:52:35Z => So that made us think in that manner only. And recently, like if you talk about like I have done internship in aura solution along with this I am doing internship from like in this eight semester curriculum it is compulsory in our college to do internship like we don't have any final exam this semester.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T13:52:15Z, 2025-03-20T13:52:20Z => Hmm.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:52:34Z, 2025-03-20T13:52:38Z => We will be evaluated on the basis of this internship only.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:52:39Z, 2025-03-20T13:52:46Z => So right now I am engaged with one company for that purpose and I have done implemented RAG actually.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:52:47Z, 2025-03-20T13:52:58Z => Retrieval augmentation generation. So that model i have implemented and like if you want, I can show you how it's it works like I have made a project on that also.",-1
"Swami Subramanian, 2025-03-20T13:52:57Z, 2025-03-20T13:53:01Z => Sure, sure. Go ahead.",-1

"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:53:21Z, 2025-03-20T13:53:36Z => So basically I used my resume as my data set like here what it is going and doing the rag basically what happens see why why do we need rag First of all, I'll tell you, like, see, we have so many LLMs.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T13:53:31Z, 2025-03-20T13:53:37Z => Hmm. Hmm.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T13:53:36Z, 2025-03-20T13:53:41Z => Hmm. Hmm.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:53:36Z, 2025-03-20T13:53:46Z => These LLMs are trained on data set. So suppose I trained an llm today And I am using that LLM after like three, four months.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T13:53:42Z, 2025-03-20T13:53:48Z => Hmm.",-1

"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:53:47Z, 2025-03-20T13:53:53Z => So in this in between these three four months, there are some changes in the data there will be some change in the data.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T13:53:54Z, 2025-03-20T13:54:00Z => Meaning new data sets have added to this.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:53:54Z, 2025-03-20T13:54:01Z => So yeah, many new things will be getting added. So if we are using the LLM for after four months.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:54:00Z, 2025-03-20T13:54:06Z => Then the LLM will not have the knowledge about what happened in this four months.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:54:07Z, 2025-03-20T13:54:12Z => So in that case like to solve the problem of that this rag thing came into picture.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:54:12Z, 2025-03-20T13:54:31Z => So it was developed by, I think, Meta, Meta itself So basically what it does, it uses the data, the LLM which has its own data set. Along with this, the rag uh had some like it uses some extra data set which you want to give to the",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:54:32Z, 2025-03-20T13:54:42Z => Model. So it combines the results of both the things and it gives you the action like suppose I have took my resume I uploaded my resume in PDF form.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T13:54:42Z, 2025-03-20T13:54:48Z => Hmm. Okay. Okay.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:54:43Z, 2025-03-20T13:55:06Z => And now I extracted the text from this so it uh got uh like processed yeah So after extracting of the text it see it gave me results like this so after that what happens rag stores the stores these things in the in the form of in a vector database",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T13:54:50Z, 2025-03-20T13:54:56Z => Okay.",-1

"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:55:30Z, 2025-03-20T13:55:45Z => Like one is the index and in the second contains the data. So here I have taken two like it has divided the data into chunks So I have taken in my model, I have taken two lines like each chunk will consist of two lines",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T13:55:43Z, 2025-03-20T13:55:47Z => Hmm. Hmm.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:55:45Z, 2025-03-20T13:56:06Z => So whenever I want to like from this resume okay i have taken the resume but there can be a book of 800 pdfs So if any person wants to know something he it is not like he'll have to read all the pages again and again and again so here in our model like he can search for specific words and",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T13:55:56Z, 2025-03-20T13:56:02Z => Hmm.",-1

"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:56:07Z, 2025-03-20T13:56:11Z => The model will give you results which are matching with those with that word.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T13:56:11Z, 2025-03-20T13:56:17Z => Can we do a test here? Can you search for something",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:56:12Z, 2025-03-20T13:56:21Z => Yeah, we can do testing here also Like…",-1

"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T13:57:55Z, 2025-03-20T13:58:01Z => But you can start from 15th, right?",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:57:57Z, 2025-03-20T13:58:10Z => Yeah, after 15th I can. But what I feel like if I get selected, I means I have not been to my home For past two years, sir.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T13:58:10Z, 2025-03-20T13:58:15Z => No, you can do that. That's okay.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:58:10Z, 2025-03-20T13:58:14Z => So yeah, so I'll take a buffer for 10 days minimum.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:58:15Z, 2025-03-20T13:58:22Z => So like probably in May, it is not running yet. Just a second, sir.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:58:26Z, 2025-03-20T13:58:32Z => Okay.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:59:12Z, 2025-03-20T13:59:19Z => Usually doesn't take that much time. Sir, I have a video recording of this. I can show you. Yeah, okay.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:59:20Z, 2025-03-20T13:59:41Z => Okay, sir. So see, suppose they see you can see in my text file process text like resume.txt So suppose, see, I have artificial intelligence word here So suppose i artificial intelligence I'll type, sir. So it will give me the results.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T13:59:31Z, 2025-03-20T13:59:37Z => Yeah.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:59:40Z, 2025-03-20T13:59:53Z => Whatever uh like it will i have put it to i have set it to give top two best similar results so it is that's what it is giving that uh That is the first line and the second line. Here's the score.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T13:59:53Z, 2025-03-20T14:00:02Z => What the score is basically What is the distance of this like these lines from my word app that is what it is.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:00:02Z, 2025-03-20T14:00:17Z => Can you ask like can you can you frame the query in the format of a question Okay, can we type in what I'm saying? Give me one second so Does Harsh like taking on challenging roles.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:00:06Z, 2025-03-20T14:00:12Z => I can frame curie also like that. Yeah, yeah, sure, sir.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:00:18Z, 2025-03-20T14:00:32Z => It is giving me the things which are there in my resume right now. I have not in… Okay, so does hers like taking",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:00:24Z, 2025-03-20T14:00:33Z => No, that's fine. Let's do this, no. Taking on challenging roles yeah That's fine.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:00:31Z, 2025-03-20T14:00:37Z => Taking one.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:00:36Z, 2025-03-20T14:00:41Z => Yeah, question mark.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:00:39Z, 2025-03-20T14:00:46Z => Yeah, it has given me like it it matched with hers i think and it is giving me like my GitHub link and like my address.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:00:46Z, 2025-03-20T14:00:53Z => So it's like not properly processing it.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:00:48Z, 2025-03-20T14:00:54Z => So yeah, like I have not integrated it with LLM like that is that is the next part of it.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:00:53Z, 2025-03-20T14:00:59Z => Huh.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:00:54Z, 2025-03-20T14:01:04Z => So if I'll integrate it with LLM, then it will combine the answer with LLM and it will generate. Right now it is only giving whatever it is whatever that is stored in the text file.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:01:00Z, 2025-03-20T14:01:07Z => Yeah. So why do you need an LLM? Why don't you combine it with an SLM?",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:01:07Z, 2025-03-20T14:01:14Z => For such a small task.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:01:08Z, 2025-03-20T14:01:26Z => Slm, sir, I like see the main problem statement for our company was like, see, we were actually building a Like where I am doing internship they are actually building a model like talk to data there will be building a natural language to sql thing",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:01:27Z, 2025-03-20T14:01:47Z => So there they have a data set in the form of table and that table is basically associated with some company so there the company like what are the sales and all so they are so see you are a the owner of any business. But suppose you don't know how to write the SQL queries so",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:01:30Z, 2025-03-20T14:01:36Z => Hmm. Hmm.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:01:36Z, 2025-03-20T14:01:43Z => So they're querying like they're using natural language",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:01:46Z, 2025-03-20T14:02:02Z => It will solve that problem sir too like you can do natural review like they have built a model and I tested, I personally tested the, like I didn't build that model. Like one Australian guy is there who had built that model. I personally tested it for 120 questions.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:01:50Z, 2025-03-20T14:01:55Z => But how accurately will it solve the problem?",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:02:02Z, 2025-03-20T14:02:11Z => And that model was giving results almost 85% accurately, sir. Like there were still issues with the joints and all.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:02:09Z, 2025-03-20T14:02:26Z => So how will this Yeah. So how will this so let's think that you can stop sharing actually How will this 15% error rate is very high in a given company Let us…",2
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:02:16Z, 2025-03-20T14:02:21Z => Yeah, okay.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:02:20Z, 2025-03-20T14:02:36Z => Actually, that's why we need rag here. We need to integrate rag in that model that rag is not has not got that that problem is coming I think there are some changes in the data set after getting the data like the model got trained.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:02:36Z, 2025-03-20T14:02:41Z => Wait, wait, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on one second.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:02:37Z, 2025-03-20T14:02:43Z => And the second thing is that uh see Yeah.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:02:42Z, 2025-03-20T14:02:52Z => When it comes to writing SQL query. There is no advancements in SQL query writing over the last 20 years. Okay. It's the same language.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:02:45Z, 2025-03-20T14:02:50Z => Yes, sir. Okay.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:02:51Z, 2025-03-20T14:02:54Z => Okay, yeah. Yes, sir.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:02:53Z, 2025-03-20T14:03:00Z => So the statement that like if you implement rag SQL query rating will become better no Nothing has changed with SQL data alerting.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:02:58Z, 2025-03-20T14:03:06Z => Okay. Huh. Okay, so maybe Yeah.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:03:00Z, 2025-03-20T14:03:11Z => Right so the whole problem is translating english to query and it is failing period the query, the SQL parameters are all the same. Nothing has changed.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:03:08Z, 2025-03-20T14:03:13Z => Yes, yes, sir.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:03:11Z, 2025-03-20T14:03:18Z => This engine which says I am trying to transform my natural language into a sequel what is it?",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:03:19Z, 2025-03-20T14:03:32Z => Yeah. Yeah, I like to add on to it like I would give you the second reason. The second reason was the model was not properly trained according to the joints like in SQL, we use so many kinds. So there were five, six tables.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:03:19Z, 2025-03-20T14:03:24Z => That's where it's failing.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:03:32Z, 2025-03-20T14:03:40Z => But the model didn't have that enough testing thing for that joint problem.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:03:40Z, 2025-03-20T14:03:47Z => So it was giving error and most of the errors were therefore complex queries such as joins only.",2
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:03:46Z, 2025-03-20T14:03:57Z => Got it. Okay. Okay, I have one more question, like nine more minutes. I want one more question Now, do we have time till 7.30? What is your time?",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:03:47Z, 2025-03-20T14:03:52Z => That was the place where the model was filming. Yeah.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:03:55Z, 2025-03-20T14:04:03Z => No issue, sir. Oh, okay. Yeah.",-1
"Swami Subramanian, 2025-03-20T14:03:57Z, 2025-03-20T14:04:03Z => Yeah.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:03:59Z, 2025-03-20T14:04:20Z => Okay, so… let us say this record this video right this call that we're having let us assume that you get a recording video recording and let's assume you get the transcript also Okay. What is like What is your approach that you'll take if I want to do two things?",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:04:08Z, 2025-03-20T14:04:15Z => Yes. Yes, sir.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:04:21Z, 2025-03-20T14:04:25Z => Let us say this transcript comes after the call. I get the transcript, I get the video.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:04:25Z, 2025-03-20T14:04:31Z => I want to do two things i want to Analyze the objective of this call.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:04:31Z, 2025-03-20T14:04:37Z => I want something to say, okay, this call was about interviewing Hirsch.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:04:37Z, 2025-03-20T14:04:43Z => Okay.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:04:39Z, 2025-03-20T14:04:48Z => Okay, that is objective i want to deduce or deduct the infer the objective of the call. The second one is Once that objective is done.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:04:43Z, 2025-03-20T14:04:49Z => It's gone.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:04:47Z, 2025-03-20T14:04:52Z => I want to remove all the waste that is not related to that objective.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:04:52Z, 2025-03-20T14:05:00Z => So for example, when we got started initially we chatted on Lakota and like Bihar and everything. All that is not related to the objective of this call.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:04:59Z, 2025-03-20T14:05:05Z => Yeah.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:05:01Z, 2025-03-20T14:05:15Z => Innovate. It may be related, but it's not related to actually the objective So I want to separate that out. Okay, this is all objective related keep that don't throw it, but it's all non-objective related, but it can be used in a different way. So how will you go about that one?",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:05:16Z, 2025-03-20T14:05:33Z => So basically I only having a transcript, right? So… what i can figure out we can do semantic analysis of this transcript to determine what is the actual purpose of this conversation.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:05:29Z, 2025-03-20T14:05:35Z => So, hmm.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:05:33Z, 2025-03-20T14:05:39Z => Hmm.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:05:34Z, 2025-03-20T14:05:45Z => And on the basis of the results, we can like it will generate me some like texture in four, five lines.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:05:45Z, 2025-03-20T14:05:50Z => And that I will store that is the first approach which is coming to my mind.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:05:51Z, 2025-03-20T14:05:57Z => Hmm.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:05:52Z, 2025-03-20T14:06:03Z => And… coming towards the video video also I have a similar kind of solution like videos with look by transcripts only.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:05:59Z, 2025-03-20T14:06:10Z => No, let's not go to video. Let's stick to the transcript. You just said like i'll do some semantic analysis. I'll give you some fair lines but I wanted to, there are two goals here The first one is like what is the objective of the call",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:06:03Z, 2025-03-20T14:06:09Z => Yeah, yeah, sir. Mm-hmm.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:06:10Z, 2025-03-20T14:06:16Z => And the second one is like separate out the non-useful part related to the objective.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:06:15Z, 2025-03-20T14:06:22Z => Given this objective it's like a conditional probability Given this objective, tell me everything like which is not related.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:06:18Z, 2025-03-20T14:06:37Z => Yes, sir. So, sir, yeah, that's what like Maybe. Okay. So the model needs to figure out by itself that what was the actual objective we are not going to specify anything in prior to the model.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:06:38Z, 2025-03-20T14:07:02Z => Okay. So what we can do we can go through we can like the model can read all the text and it on the basis of that it can generate that the majority part of the conversation was regarding what like probability it can determine that okay like 40 was this like 20 10 20 was this",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:06:53Z, 2025-03-20T14:06:57Z => Hmm. Hmm.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:07:01Z, 2025-03-20T14:07:12Z => And like 60% was the technical discussion So that probability we can find out and on the basis of that we can fetch the results.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:07:12Z, 2025-03-20T14:07:19Z => So I'm going to do one thing. I think we have our bot recording actually I'm going to give you the transcript of this call.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:07:14Z, 2025-03-20T14:07:20Z => Yes, sir.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:07:19Z, 2025-03-20T14:07:28Z => Okay. After this meeting, after the meeting ends. I'm going to give you the transcript of this call. And then you do that for me I'll give you 24 hours.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:07:21Z, 2025-03-20T14:07:25Z => Okay. Okay.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:07:25Z, 2025-03-20T14:07:31Z => Uh huh. Okay, sir.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:07:31Z, 2025-03-20T14:07:39Z => You can do whatever can be done in 24 hours. Like there's no perfection because I know that I'm giving you only 24 hours and so the output will not be that perfect.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:07:39Z, 2025-03-20T14:07:44Z => Right? So that's all okay. I just want to see like what sort of libraries you use.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:07:40Z, 2025-03-20T14:07:45Z => Yes, sir. What?",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:07:45Z, 2025-03-20T14:07:47Z => And just stick to transcript only. Don't worry about the video part.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:07:47Z, 2025-03-20T14:07:57Z => Okay um you guys can be creative and like everything you guys know what it is and like you've been to quota i'm sure like you know how to handle the situation.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:07:57Z, 2025-03-20T14:08:11Z => So that's one task. I wanted like, see, and then uh And actually, if you are I would recommend you set up like 15 minutes with us same time tomorrow.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:07:59Z, 2025-03-20T14:08:04Z => Yes, sir.",-1
"Harsh, 2025-03-20T14:08:12Z, 2025-03-20T14:08:17Z => Same time. Okay, sir. Yes, sir.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:08:14Z, 2025-03-20T14:08:19Z => Does it work? Does it work? Okay, so I will send out an invite to keep it simple.",-1
"Srinivas Guddanti, 2025-03-20T14:08:19Z, 2025-03-20T14:08:24Z => So you make sure that you're in a position where you can take the call, 15 minutes call so that we can see what you've done.",-1
